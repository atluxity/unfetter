# unfetter-discover

Unfetter Discover web application and container resources. Visit
[unfetter.io](http://unfetter.io) for more information about Unfetter projects.

## System Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## The Project Setup
The entire application, Unfetter Discover, is made up of multiple of docker
containers. Each builds upon the other. We use
[Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose) to manage
the startup and shutdown of all those Docker containers.

The GitHub organization [unfetter-discover](1) houses a GitHub project for
every container. There are two ways to run Unfetter Discover:

1. You can run all the containers from Docker Hub, without recompiling. This
is recommended for most cases.

2. If you are a developer and would like to build the Unfetter-Discover project
from source, then you will need to clone all the repos in [unfetter-discover](https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover)
and use the `docker-compose.development.yml` config file.

### Case 1: Build from Docker Hub.  Normal Use Case

You will only need to clone the unfetter project. Then, run docker-compose
with default arguments. First, go into your working directory that you want
to clone the main project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unfetter-discover/unfetter.git
cd unfetter
docker-compose up
```

### Case 2: Build from local source files.  Developer Use Case

Create a directory to hold all the projects, 
```bash
mkdir unfetter-discover
cd unfetter-discover
```
Next, you will need to clone all the projects in [unfetter-discover](https://www.github.com/unfetter-discover).  
```bash
 curl -s https://api.github.com/orgs/unfetter-discover/repos\?per_page\=200 | perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if (/"clone_url": "([^"]+)/)' | xargs -n 1 git clone
 ```
 Next, change directories into the unfetter directory, which houses the docker-compose.yml files, and run docker-compose
 ```
 cd unfetter
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up
```

### The Web Application

After running the `docker-compose` command you can view the application at:

https://localhost/unfetter-discover-ui/

> Note: If you receive a 404 error from nginx, ensure you include the trailing slash
> on the URL

Unfetter-Discover will create certs and store them locally. You will need to
accept the certificates to move forward.
